This is a test context for KGRAG pipeline.

The KGRAG system is a knowledge graph-based retrieval augmented generation framework. It consists of several components:

1. Graph Construction: This module builds a knowledge graph from input text documents.
2. Edge Embedding: This creates vector embeddings for graph edges using various embedding models.
3. Answer Generation: This uses the knowledge graph to generate answers to questions.
4. Evaluation: This measures the quality of generated answers using metrics like F1 score.

The pipeline can process different types of datasets including hotpotQA and UltraDomain datasets. Each dataset contains contexts and question-answer pairs that are used for training and evaluation.

The system uses OpenAI's GPT models for answer generation and various embedding models for creating vector representations of the knowledge graph components.
